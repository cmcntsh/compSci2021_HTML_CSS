# Learning HTML & CSS

This is part of a set of pages on introduction to computer science. https://github.com/cmcntsh/IntroCompSci2021_topics

A note on the content for weeks 9 - 12 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript Basics, and JavaScript DOM Manipulation). This content was given to me by the Biomedical Informatics department and created by a coding boot camp called VSchool. The assignments are simply assignment descriptions with no accompanying tutorial about how to complete them. (There's less support for completing these than what you had for the Python assignments.) Make sure you start the assignments early in the week and use the discussion board to get help from classmates. Don't leave the work until they're due because it may take you a bit more time to look at them and ask questions if needed.

We're going to dive right in to learning some HTML and CSS. A lot of user interfaces are designed using elements of HTML and CSS. Get started on the projects as soon as possible. Work on the projects before spending time on the optional material. Working together is encouraged both through the discussion board and in office hours.

* Here's a quick and easy way to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in VSCode. This individual creates a bit of a folder structure for organizing a larger web site. You don't need to create all the folders for the assignments for this class. I would just put all 3 files in the same folder. You can pretty much start all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assignments by creating these base files and linking them together as shown in this video.

* Here's a tutorial which puts the process of coding a web page using HTML & CSS all together. Learning web development is a bit of a moving target, so I tried to find something which is current so you can see what types of tools and techniques are probably most common right now. Modern web development really focuses on adapting displays appropriate for the device which is being used. This tutorial shows some of how that is done, so it's worth watching. I like his process of making a design, creating the content in HTML, and creating the formatting in CSS quite a bit. I think he describes a good process and work flow for creating pages. I wish I could say I could code pages like this guy, but I can't. :) (at least not that quickly)

## Optional Material

* If you want to understand what current front-end and back-end web development involves, I highly recommend you watch this video. I don't even know what some of the things he mentions are, but I like having the current overview. Web development like the rest of computing is a dynamic and ever-changing field. It's good to keep current in the areas you want to focus on. Web Development in 2021 - A Practical Guide (1 hour 5 min):
